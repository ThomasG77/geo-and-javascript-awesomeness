# geo-and-javascript-awesomeness

Due to a BOF (Birds of a feather) about JavaScript and Geo at [FOSS4G Europe 2015](http://europe.foss4g.org/2015/), we decided to start a repo to make inventory of JS Geo libraries and of some non-geo related libraries that change the way to code in JavaScript.

Feel free to submit more change to the repository with a PR or by contacting us at Twitter account [ThomasG77](http://twitter.com/ThomasG77)!!
